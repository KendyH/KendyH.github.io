# Portfolio ![CI status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen.svg)

### Welcome to the Andr3w-Pham.github.io wiki!

## Design Process


### Portfolio Contents
I made a wireframe before actually designing it. Which includes the sections below.

-	Home Page
-	About Me
-	Skills
-	Projects
-	Contact

### Layout Design
I have zero experience with making a website. So designing my portfolio by myself was extremely difficult. So I browsed through other developers' portfolios and other websites such as https://codepen.io/ which had examples on their site. I drew some inspiration from the portfolios and examples that I saw to design my own portfolio

After deciding on the overall layout, I officially took my first steps in making my portfolio.

### Images/Multimedia
Found my homepage image from google images. I chose an image which fitted the colour scheme.


I used https://fontawesome.com/ for my icons.
